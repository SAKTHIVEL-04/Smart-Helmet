# Smart-Helmet
OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT
Enhance Rider Safety: Implement a system that ensures the bike engine only starts
when the rider is wearing a helmet, reducing the risk of head injuries in accidents.
Prevent Drunk Driving: Integrate a breath analyzer into the helmet to measure the
rider's alcohol level, preventing the bike from starting if the rider is intoxicated.
Automate Safety Compliance: Create an automated system that enforces helmet
usage and sobriety checks without the need for external monitoring.
Reduce Road Accidents: Contribute to reducing the number of road accidents caused
by not wearing helmets or driving under the influence of alcohol.
